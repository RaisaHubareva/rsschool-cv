## About me

I decided to change my life. I am currently working as engineer in a  factory. I hope my professional experience will be useful in IT.

I haven't programming skills yet. Hopefully I will get an experience at the end of the course.

I studied programming on my own.

    for (j = 0; j < number; j++) {
      if (i == j) {
        rez[i][j] = 1;
      } else {
        rez[i][j] = 0;
      }
    }
  }
  console.log(rez);
